                <p className='py-4 text-gray-600 max-w-[70%] mx-auto tracking-wider text-lg'> Iâ€™m a 24 year old female who resides in Uganda,and a Cytotechnology graduate of Makerere University. I am seeking a front-end development position that will let me use my skills and abilities to advance both professionally and personally, while also helping the company to thrive. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript as a front-end web developer. I have also worked with various modern frameworks and libraries such as React, Tailwind CSS, and Redux to create visually appealing, interactive and user-friendly interfaces. I have experience working on web projects, including building an e-commerce app UI, a weather app, a self-portfolio app, a to-do list app, an IMDb-clone project and landing pages all available in the projects section below. One of my key strengths is my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies and programming languages. This is reflected in my willingness to take on new challenges and learn from experienced developers. I'm also proficient in the English language, which makes it easy for me to communicate with clients and collaborate with team members. With these skills, I am confident that I bring a unique perspective experience necessary to make a valuable contribution to the team. I am looking forward to the opportunity to work on-site or remotely with a diverse group of people from different backgrounds.</p>
